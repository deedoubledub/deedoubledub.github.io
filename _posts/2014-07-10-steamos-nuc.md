I recently (May) built a small form-factor computer for use as a SteamOS
living room gaming console. I wanted to use an Intel NUC because they are
slick little devices with enough power to drive most games and capable of
running the rest with Steam In-Home Streaming. The small form-factor fits in
nicely in the living room and the machine is fairly silent; it cannot be
heard if any audio is playing in the room.

This is the rundown of everything I purchased for the build. Additional
hardware that I had on hand include a mouse, keyboard, and a wireless XBox
360 controller. I'd like to add a wireless mouse and keyboard combo at some
point.

I am currently running the beta SteamOS and everything has worked out fairly
well. You know, outside of the normal issues that you encounter with bad
linux ports.

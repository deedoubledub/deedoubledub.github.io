My current primary computer was built in 2011. It's time to build a new one.
Over the past month I have been purchasing components to build a new beastly
computer. I now have most of what I need and the final pieces will arrive in
the next few days.

[Here's the build:](http://pcpartpicker.com/user/deedoubledub/saved/WJFhP6)
CPU: Intel Core i7-5820K 3.3GHz 6-Core Processor
Motherboard: ASRock Fatal1ty X99X Killer/3.1 ATX LGA2011-3
Memory: Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (4 x 4GB) DDR4-2666
Storage: Samsung 850 EVO-Series 500GB 2.5" Solid State Drive
Video Card: Zotac GeForce GTX 980 Ti 6GB
Case: Phanteks Enthoo EVOLV ATX
Power Supply: Corsair AX760

I put everything that I currently have together to verify that it all works.
I don't have the 980 Ti yet, so I threw in an old Radeon 5850 that I had
lying around.

The case is scheduled to arrive today, so the next step will be to give
these parts a permanent home.

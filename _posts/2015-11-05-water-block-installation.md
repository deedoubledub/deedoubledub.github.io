The next step in building my new computer was to start installing water
blocks. This is my first time water cooling and it has been an interesting
journey of researching, shopping, and finally building. Here are a few
photos I captured of the install process for the CPU water block. The water
block that I used in this system is the [EK-Supremacy EVO RED Edition](https://shop.ekwb.com/ek-supremacy-evo-red-edition).

Before installing the water block on the processor and motherboard, I opened
it up and replaced the jet plate to match the recommendations for my
particular processor.

Installing the water block on this motherboard was as simple as applying
thermal paste and screwing the block to the existing CPU cooler mounting
threads.

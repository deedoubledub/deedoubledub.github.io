Independence Day is coming up and every year my cousin and I put on a
fantastic fireworks display for a large family party. We built a pair of
20-mortar racks last year and this week we built two more. Now we can
pre-load 80 shells, fuse them together, and let the show run on auto-pilot.

These racks are based on a design found on pyrouniverse. We added pipe
clamps on each side to stablize each rack by driving a length of rebar into
the ground. The handles make for easy carrying in the field. I ordered cut
and plugged tubes from mortartubes.net.

I've been working on some other fireworks related projects that I plan on
posting here soon.
